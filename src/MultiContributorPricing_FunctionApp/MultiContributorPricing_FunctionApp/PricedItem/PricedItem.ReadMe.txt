Priced Item
===========

A priced item is an uniquely identifiable thing that can have a price history.  This could, for example, be an exchange rate, a stock price, government bond etc.

The identifier should include the type, so that this uniqueness can be enforced across categories.

Each contributor should also have a lookup ability to help map their unique identifier to the system-wide standard priced item identifier.
